# Twine Projects

Welcome to my collection of interactive **Twine games** designed for the classroom. These projects are written in HTML and hosted with GitHub Pages to create immersive learning experiences for students â€” especially in **science and math**.

## Design Document

### 1. Galactic Referee Series

ðŸ““ [Design Document](GalacticReferee.ipynb)  
An interactive Twine game design doc using storytelling to teach dimensional analysis.

Includes screenshots, scaffolding examples, and branching logic.

### 2. Advanced Dimensional Analysis

ðŸ““ [Design Document](Advanced_DA.ipynb)  
A sequel to the Galactic Referee series, this Twine game challenges learners to apply dimensional analysis with squared and cubed units in a new sci-fi setting.


## Projects

### 1. [Galactic Referee Training](https://griffinkennedy.github.io/twine-projects/Galactic-Referee-Training.html)
An interactive game that introduces the concept of **unit conversion** through a fun sci-fi narrative. Students take on the role of a Galactic Referee, comparing alien racers who all report speeds in different units.

Skills practiced:
- Dimensional analysis
- Cancelling units
- Multistep conversions

---

### 2. [Galactic Referee Practice](https://griffinkennedy.github.io/twine-projects/Galactic-Referee-Practice.html)
A more advanced continuation of the first adventure. Players solve **multi-step unit conversion challenges** and must apply what they've learned to identify the true winner in an alien race showdown.

Skills reinforced:
- Converting compound units (e.g. zorbits/glarb to qflops/korrog)
- Drag-and-drop practice for chain conversions
- Critical thinking with real-time feedback

---

### 3. [Advanced Dimensional Analysis](https://griffinkennedy.github.io/twine-projects/Advanced-DA.html)  
A story-driven sequel that challenges players with **complex unit conversions** across time-warped anomalies. As the ChronoSkiffâ€™s onboard analyst, students must stabilize reality using square and cubic conversions, chained ratios, and logic-based dimensional reasoning.

Skills practiced:
- Area and volume unit conversions  
- Chained dimensional analysis  
- Interpreting squared and cubed units in context

## How to Use

1. Click any of the links above to launch the activity in your browser.
2. Students can work through the game interactively â€” no installations required.
3. All games are self-contained HTML files built using [Twine](https://twinery.org/) with the SugarCube format.
