# Twine Projects

Welcome to my collection of interactive **Twine games** designed for the classroom. These projects are written in HTML and hosted with GitHub Pages to create immersive learning experiences for students — especially in **science and math**.

## Projects

### 1. [Galactic Referee Training](https://griffinkennedy.github.io/twine-projects/Galactic-Referee-Training.html)
An interactive game that introduces the concept of **unit conversion** through a fun sci-fi narrative. Students take on the role of a Galactic Referee, comparing alien racers who all report speeds in different units.

Skills practiced:
- Dimensional analysis
- Cancelling units
- Multistep conversions

### 2. [Galactic Referee Practice](https://griffinkennedy.github.io/twine-projects/Galactic%20Referee%20Practice.html)
A more advanced continuation of the first adventure. Players solve **multi-step unit conversion challenges** and must apply what they've learned to identify the true winner in an alien race showdown.

Skills reinforced:
- Converting compound units (e.g. zorbits/glarb to qflops/korrog)
- Drag-and-drop practice for chain conversions
- Critical thinking with real-time feedback
